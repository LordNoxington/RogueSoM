# RougeSoM
An extremely janky Sub Rogue PvP routine. Was made primarly in TBC Arena. Has been adpated for SoM, but needs a lot of work to be good in BGs.

To use spell queue system, macro your abilites like below:<br>
#showtooltip Cloak of Shadows <br>
/run _G.QueueRogueCast("Cloak Of Shadows", "player") <br>
/cast Cloak Of Shadows
